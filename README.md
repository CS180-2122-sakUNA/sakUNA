Due to the geographical location of the Philippines, the country experiences many natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, etc. With a World Risk Index Score of 26.70% last 2016 [5], the Philippines remain as one of the countries most affected by natural disasters. Hence, immediate attention is needed especially because natural disasters are getting even more destructive due to climate change [6]. To help in mitigating the effects of natural disasters or enhancing disaster risk management, implementing disaster response maps using Twitter data can be helpful in planning an efficient response [4].
